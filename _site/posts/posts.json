New football season is always a fun time of year.\nHere are a couple things I will be monitoring as the season progresses:\nTeam run defense\nThere has been a lot of discussion on the increasing importance of the run game as teams increase defensive focus on stopping the pass with increasing rates of two-high coverages.\n\n\n\nBased on Dallas’ position on this chart- high stuff rate with a below-average DVOA after playing Philadelphia in week 1, I’m interested in creating a sneak-adjusted stuff rate (a “successful” quarterback sneak or tush push converting a 4th & 1 would still go down as a run stuff).\nI’ll share progress on that as the season continues.\nUnder center dropbacks\nSeveral of my favorite podcasts- The Athletic Football Show, Football 301, and others mentioned to watch out for more under center dropback passes with no play action this season. I’ll be studying these plays to see when it succeeds and why it fails.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, per FTN charting, 2.78% of passes were under center and did not include play action.\nThrough Week 1 in 2025, that jumped up to 3.39%! It’ll be interesting to see if this holds.\nMatthew Stafford with 3 step dropbacks from under center in the year 2025[image or embed]— Nate Tice (@natetice.bsky.social) September 8, 2025 at 4:34 PM\nCode to generate the figures in this post can be found on the topfiftyone github repository\nCap figures courtesy of overthecap.com\ntopfiftyone is powered by Distill.\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\n\n\n\n",

    "contents": "\r\nThis blog was supposed to be a New Year’s resolution. I suppose I could call it a New Football Season resolution.\r\nAnyway, it’s great to have football back. Here are a few things I noticed from the first week of games.\r\nReich and Smith putting the training wheels on their young QBs\r\nI was anticipating this Carolina-Atlanta game since it included two quarterbacks debuting as QB1.\r\nIt was evident that Frank Reich and Arthur Smith wanted to keep things simple for their young QBs by focusing early downs on running the ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina and Atlanta were 2 of the bottom 4 teams in early-down pass rate in week one. A single game is of course a small sample, so it’ll be interesting to see if these teams open up the playbook on early downs as the season goes on (particularly Carolina as they get DJ Chark back from injury).\r\nUnrelated thought: Brian Burns is awesome. Pay him.\r\nMonken engineering touches for Zay Flowers\r\nA lot has been said about this, but it definitely jumped out when watching the game. A couple of first-quarter jet sweeps and nearly two-thirds of his receiving yards coming after the catch tells me OC Todd Monken designed a gameplan to get the ball in Flowers’ hands in space and let him work.\r\n\r\n\r\nWide Receiver Involvement\r\n    Targets and carries per 50 offensive snaps\r\n    \r\n      Player\r\n      Targets and Carries per 50\r\n    \r\nT.Hill\r\n11.72\r\nD.Hopkins\r\n10.32\r\nS.Diggs\r\n9.56\r\nJ.Jefferson\r\n9.38\r\nZ.Flowers\r\n9.38\r\nJ.Chase\r\n9.26\r\nP.Nacua\r\n9.26\r\nJ.Meyers\r\n9.09\r\nD.Adams\r\n8.18\r\nC.Ridley\r\n7.97\r\n\r\nFlowers measured up with offense centerpieces like Justin Jefferson, Stefon Diggs, and Ja’Marr Chase in terms of involvement in the offense. This will certainly fall back a bit when the Ravens get Mark Andrews back from injury, but it’s exciting for the Ravens and recently-extended Lamar Jackson to have skill players worth planning around.\r\nSeattle’s Pass Rush\r\nThe biggest factor I noticed in the Rams’ upset victory over the Seahawks was how clean Matt Stafford was all game- Seattle managed zero sacks in the contest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not the return Seattle wanted to see after an offseason of investment in the defensive front: They made Dre’Mont Jones the 13th highest paid interior defender in terms of APY, as well as the $45 million contract extension for Uchenna Nwosu.\r\nOne reason for optimism on this unit is Seattle ranked 10th in ESPN’s Pass Rush Win Rate in week one. This tells me that Seattle has the ingredients for some effective pass rush, but clever pocket movement from Stafford may have limited their measured pass rush statistics.\r\n\r\nCode to generate the figures in this post can be found on the topfiftyone github repository\r\nCap figures courtesy of overthecap.com\r\ntopfiftyone is powered by Distill.\r\nDistill is a publication format for scientific and technical writing, native to the web.\r\nLearn more about using Distill at https://rstudio.github.io/distill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
